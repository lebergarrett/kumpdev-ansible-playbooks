# k3s-cluster -- Automated build of HA k3s Cluster with `kube-vip` and MetalLB

This playbook will build an HA Kubernetes cluster with `k3s`, `kube-vip` and MetalLB via `ansible`.

This is based on the work from [this fork](https://github.com/212850a/k3s-ansible) which is based on the work from [k3s-io/k3s-ansible](https://github.com/k3s-io/k3s-ansible). It uses [kube-vip](https://kube-vip.chipzoller.dev/) to create a load balancer for control plane, and [metal-lb](https://metallb.universe.tf/installation/) for its service `LoadBalancer`.

If you want more context on how this works, see:
